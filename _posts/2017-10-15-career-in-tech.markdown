In high school I tutored middle school students Algebra.  In junior college, I was doing really well so my professor encouraged me to the join the spring’s cohort of computer lab aides.  And forunately last fall, I  particiapetd in a program visited high school students in San Jose to urge them to pursue a career in tech.

The main purpose of my first teaching position was for college apps.  I was a junior in high school and was building up my volunteer hours for college apps.  The thought of helping middle school students navigate order of operations seemed like an easy way to score extra hours.

A few years laer in community college, I was doing really well in my introduction to programming course.  After class one day my professor, Michelle, stopped by my desk and commended me for my well documented code.  Those who know me well know I can be a stickler when it comes to organzation.  So for me, pretty looking code with symmetrical code blocks seemed like a normal progression.  Michelle had a contagious passion for helping students succeed.  When she asked me to help around the lab it took me all but two seconds to agree.  At the time, programming “seemed like a safe career choice" so I took courses in programming so I could transfer to a 4 year university.  Thanks to Michelle and my community college I discovered an eagerness to help others who need it.

Last fall I was fortunate enough to volunteer on behalf of Facebook and help high school students and their teachers work through specific STEM related assignments.  

Many students, especially now, are fortunate enough to be exposed to programming in their primary education.  As I near the completion of my college degree, I’ve met many students who've been building their own computers since middle school.  And also others who have been deploying websites since high school.  I didn’t really fully understand a basic C++ program till I was almost 20.  The importance of introducing programmi

Many programmers I've met have known that they wanted to pursude a life in tech from early adolescence.  Others don’t figure it out till high school, and for most of us we don’t figure it out till college or later.  

For myself, it wasn’t until last summer that I really found enjoyment for learning new frameworks and programming languages.  As you've heard many times before, the tech industry is growing rapidly which means there are oppurtunities for careers.  So this is my open ended invitation to everybody out there to read up on software.  Everything from a five minute intro video on youtube, to an informational book, to taking a course online.
