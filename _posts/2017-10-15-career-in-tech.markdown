In high school I tutored middle school students in the city next over in Algebra.  In junior college, I was doing really well so my professor encouraged me to the join the spring’s cohort of lab aides.  Last fall, I was fortunate enough to be part of a program that visited high school students in San Jose to urge them to pursue a career in tech.

The main purpose of my first teaching position was for college apps.  I was a junior in high school and was building up my volunteer hours for my college apps.  The thought of helping students who needed help in Algebra seemed simple enough.

In community college, I was doing really well in my programming assignments.  After class one day my professor, Michelle, stopped by my desk and told me my code was very well organized and thought out.  For those who know me, they know how much of stickler I can be when it comes to organization and cleanliness.  So for me, pretty looking code with systemic coding seemed like a normal progression.  Michelle had a strong passion about helping others succeed of which was infective.  It took me all but two seconds to say “Yes.”   I spent most of my time in the computer lab helping others.  At the time, programming and software “seemed like a good future” so I took courses in programming so I could transfer to a 4 year university.  It was around this time that I  learned that I really enjoy helping others succeed. 

Last fall I was fortunate enough to volunteer on behalf of Facebook and help high school students and their teachers work through specific STEM related assignments.  The short term goal was to help students work through assignments, but the overarching theme was to encourage students to pursue a career in STEM.  It was the summer before this experience that I truly submerged myself in programming and technology.  By now I had already taken several programming courses and hardware classes.   

Many students, especially now, get into programming and computers from an early age.  As I near the completion of my college degree, I’ve met many students who've been building their own computers since middle schools.  And others who have been deploying websites since high school.  I didn’t really fully understand a basic C++ program till I was almost 20.  There are many of us who apathetically choose to pursue the field because of it’s promise in the future. 

Some students know exactly what they’ve wanted to do in life since early adolescence.  Others don’t figure it out till high school, and for most of us we don’t figure it out till college or later.  My brother always excelled in school, and I used him as a role model when it came to thinking about my future.  He decided to pursue a career in software.  When I was applying for colleges, I wanted to pursue a liberal arts degree, but after some discussion with my parents and deep thinking I thought an engineering degree would be a good idea.  

It wasn’t until last summer that I . So this is my open ended invitation to everybody out there to read up on software.  Everything from a five minute intro video on youtube, to an informational book, to taking a course online.  Software is a vast topic with endless applications.  Software
