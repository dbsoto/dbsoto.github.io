I'm currently a student at San José State University studying Computer Engineering.  I have experience working in IT with several software companies in Silicon Valley. 


I’ve always known that I enjoy teaching others. The time I’ve spent as an aide and mentor create a foundation from which to be an engaging and empathetic educator. On behalf of Facebook, I spent last fall assisting high school teachers and students with STEM related assignments. Although I helped students through specific assignments, the overarching goal was to encourage underrepresented students to pursue a career in technology by invoking curiosity and passion in problem solving.


I enjoy swimming in the frigid Pacific Ocean, long distance running, and taking crummy photos.
